Project Overview
This repository demonstrates multi-object tracking by combining the YOLOv8 object detector with the DeepSORT tracker. Given an input video, the system detects objects in each frame and assigns persistent IDs as they move across frames.

Features
Object detection using YOLOv8

Appearance-based tracking with DeepSORT

Color-coded bounding boxes with track IDs and confidence scores

Easy integration: swap in other YOLO weights or DeepSORT feature encoders
